== Introduction

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes *memorizing easy and efficient*. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is *much more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

BrainTrain is also a *portable* and *easy-to-navigate* desktop program. It is an *offline* application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via *easy-to-use* commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides *helpful but non-distracting visual aid*. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an *effective and straightforward* way for you to use BrainTrain.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified multiple times. For example, for the `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you can specify as many `CORE` values as you need to. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly 1 `QUESTION CORE` value.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for the `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you have to specify at least 2 `CORE` values, but you can optionally specify more than 2 `CORE` values or 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values.
* Parameters can be entered in any order. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can use the
command as such `addCard o/Country Code c/Country c/Capital`.

[[start]]
==== Starting a quiz session: `start`

Starts a new quiz session. +
Format: `start n/NAME [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

Usage rules:

* You can optionally specify the `COUNT` parameter. `COUNT` sets the number of cards to be tested in the quiz session. If no `COUNT` is specified, by default 1 card is tested.
* The name field is used to choose lesson.
* You must specify `MODE`. `MODE` sets the testing mode of the quiz session. The three available modes are `LEARN`, `PREVIEW`, `REVIEW` and `DIFFICULT`.
. PREVIEW: sees both question and answer in file order but not tested.
. DIFFICULT: sees cards labelled as difficult with both question and answer but not tested.
. REVIEW: only get tested, based on the srs value of each card.
. LEARN: sees new cards with both the question and answer first then get tested.

[NOTE]
====
Flashcards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique].

Adds a lesson. +
Format: `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`

Usage rules:

* You must specify `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE`. `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` sets the `CORE` headers describing the question and answer `CORE` values of flashcards added to this lesson.
** For example, a lesson for memorising the capitals of countries will have the `QUESTION CORE` set as "Country" and `ANSWER_CORE` set as "Capital".
* You can optionally specify 0 or more additional `CORE` headers (e.g. "Language"), which can be set as the `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` by using the command `editLesson`.
* You can only add flashcards which have `QUESTION CORE`, `ANSWER CORE` and `CORE` values which correspond to the lesson's `CORE` headers.
* You can optionally specify 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values (e.g. "Hint").
** Flash cards added to the lesson *need not* have corresponding `OPTIONAL` values.
** `OPTIONAL` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

Examples:

* `addLesson n/Upper limb anatomy q/Statement a/TrueOrFalse`

// TODO
== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????` or question marks? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-ASCII characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed in Excel by going into the Save As dialog, and saving as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. For other csv file editors, you may need to look up relevant documentation on how save in UTF-8 encoding. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a UTF-8 encoded csv file.

Note that the files have to be saved as a UTF-8 encoded csv file before the first save. +
If the file is saved without UTF-8 encoding, the data may have already been saved as ?????, and all non-ASCII characters are lost.
****

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder.
